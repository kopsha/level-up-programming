# level-up-programming

Here I collect fundamental concepts, principles, and examples that experienced
programmers may eventually learn through practice, mistakes, and maintenance of
real systems.

The focus is not on languages or frameworks, but on how to think about software:
design, boundaries, trade-offs, and long-term consequences.

If you already know how to make code work and want to understand how to make it last,
this repository is for you.
